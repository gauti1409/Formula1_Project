**Data Sources**:
The Source data for this project has been referred from the Ergast API Website. This website is an experimental web service which provides a historical record of motor racing data for non-commercial purposes. The API provides data for the Formula One series, from the beginning of the world championships in 1950. The Source datasets are also placed in the Source_Datasets folder of this repository.

**Objective of the Project**:
The main objectives of the project are listed as below:
1. Ingestion of all the input files and make it available for all kinds of workloads such as Analytical Reporting, Machine Learning etc.
2. The logic for ingestion should be implemented in a way that it is able to handle the incremental data and performing the necessary transformations to produce the final datasets and create a data platform to perform the above mentioned workloads.

**Tech Stack Used**:
1. Using the Azure Cloud Services, Pyspark and Azure Databricks we will be meeting the required objectives of this project.
